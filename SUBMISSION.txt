Bellow is a list of test cases that could not be implemented:

- TC_ConnApp_012 -> step 15 - Up/down arrows of input type number are not DOM elements but native thus can't be tested
- TC_ConnApp_012 -> step 35 - 38 - File uploads can not be tested
- TC_ConnApp_012 -> step 49 - Too ambitious. Also checkmarks are not shown for all elements. When show those are at back not front
- TC_ConnApp_013 -> step 24 - 26 - File uploads can not be tested
- TC_ConnApp_014 -> step 15 - 16 - File uploads can not be tested
- TC_ConnApp_016 -> step 13 - File uploads can not be tested
- TC_ConnApp_017 -> step 11 - File uploads can not be tested
- TC_ConnApp_018 -> step 17 - File uploads can not be tested
- TC_ConnApp_021 -> step 13 - File uploads can not be tested
- TC_ConnApp_022 -> step 11 - File uploads can not be tested

There are 3 test cases that currently(at time of this submission) fail but actually should not:

- TC_ConnApp_015 -> step 25:
Save button does not change to disabled after save.
This is bug that need fix as it does disable for other type of projects.

- TC_ConnApp_016 -> step 29:
Save button does not change to disabled after save.
This is bug that need fix as it does disable for other type of projects.

- TC_ConnApp_020 -> step 9
The message in the green ribbon gets excerpted.

Bellow is a list of test cases that was not implemented:

- TC_ConnApp_002 -> steps 11 - 13 - We can not check email inbox from test runner!
- TC_ConnApp_003 -> steps 11 - 13 - We can not check email inbox from test runner!
- TC_ConnApp_005 -> step 5, 11 - We can't check valid emails as we are not able to complete the registration process
- TC_ConnApp_006 -> step 11 - We can't check valid emails as we are not able to complete the registration process
- TC_ConnApp_009 -> all steps - Even with different password this case duplicates TC_ConnApp_008 from expectation gain

Happy Testing!
